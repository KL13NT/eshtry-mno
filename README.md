## 🛰️ Eshtry Mno

> A platform to announce stores that don't sell french products! #BoycottFrenchProducts 🚀

Simple and straight-forward. Go to the home page to create a new entry in our database, go to the search page to find shops near you using the GeoLocation API and your IP. No registration, no geographical restrictions.

## 🚀 Quick start

This project frontend uses the following stack:

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) (React SSR + SSG)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for quickly iterating designs and new components
- [StorybookJS](https://storybook.js.org) for component development

1. **Install required packages**
   I use Yarn, so the installation command is `yarn`.

2. **Start developing on the frontend**
   Navigate into the cloned repo directory and start it up.

   ```bash
   cd eshtry-mno
   yarn dev
   ```

3. **Open the source code and start editing!**

   The project is now running at `http://localhost:3000`!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in this project.

    .
    ├── .next
    ├── .storybook
    ├── node_modules
    ├── pages
    ├── public
    ├── src

1.  **`/.next`**: This directory is produced by Nextjs for development purposes.

2.  **`/.storybook`**: This directory includes configuration files for Storybook.

3.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all installed packages.

4.  **`/pages`**: This directory contains all frontend pages, SSG'ed and SSR'ed.

5.  **`/public`**: This directory contains all files you wish to turn up in the production website output.

6.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end (what you see in the browser) such as React components, Storybook stories, and styling. `src` is a convention for “source code”.
